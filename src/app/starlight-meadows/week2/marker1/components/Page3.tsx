This activity is a wonderful opportunity to encourage your child and build their confidence in artistic exploration. Additionally, it allows your child to practice their motor skills, by pouring ingredients into the playdough recipe, and by playing with the finished dough. Your child will also get more experience interacting with shapes and colors.`;
