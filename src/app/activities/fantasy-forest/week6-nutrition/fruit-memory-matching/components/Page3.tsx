The purpose of this activity is to practice their memory recall and sequential memory by matching the cards with the same fruit on them, but it also helps your child recognize healthy foods that they may see on a daily basis. By explaining to your child that these foods are necessary for them to grow big and strong, you are helping them learn about making nutritious choices for their health long-term.`;
