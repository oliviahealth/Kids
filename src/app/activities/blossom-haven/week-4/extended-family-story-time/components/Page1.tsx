              The primary topic of your infant's (0-1 year old) language, literacy, and speech growth is getting them exposed to words through talking, reading, and even singing. Child growth and development experts state that reading to them greatly helps in your child reaching their milestones. For this activity, we're going to work on getting your child exposed to different words, pictures, and sounds by getting yourself and other family members reading with your child. We want to highlight the importance of getting multiple members of your family, or support system, to be included in this activity because it will not only create bonds with your child, but hearing the different ways people speak will strengthen their language, literacy, and speech skills later in life.
