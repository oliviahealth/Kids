Your child will not understand the difference between oil and water, but the bright colors and lava lamp experience gets them interested and wanting to learn from the sensory bag. Creating more sensory bags with different colors and varied amounts of oil/water will also support your childâ€™s development. Continual exposure of the sensory bag is key to your child understanding their world, and this activity will get them on track to reach their math & science growth and development milestones in no time.`;
