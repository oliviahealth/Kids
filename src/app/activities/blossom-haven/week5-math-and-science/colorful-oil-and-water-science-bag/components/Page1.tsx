        introductionText="Growing and developing your 0-1 year oldâ€™s math & science skills comes from getting them exposed to different shapes, colors, and activities that get your child interested and making observations in their head. An interesting activity that will get your child's attention is a colorful water and oil sensory bag. The science behind this is that water and oil do not mix, and adding in some food coloring almost creates a lava lamp in a bag for your child to observe and touch to feel and gain information. The bright colors, shape, and feel of the oil and water in the bag will gain your child's attention and they will want to keep touching these sensory bags to try and get an understanding for what they are feeling/seeing. You will also be able to expose them to the words of the items in this activity so they become familiar with parts of this activity."
