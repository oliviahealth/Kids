Some of the best ways to get your child on track to reach their milestones include skin to skin contact, talking to your baby in both a childlike and adult conversation, and playing games with your child.",

Taking a walk with your child exposes them to nature, animals, and other people, working on communication skills, learning emotions, and gaining sensory experiences.",

        "The final stage of socialization for your 0-1 year old involves meeting other children, preferably children around their age. This can be done with other children in the family, friends and their kids, or community childcare groups. Getting your child exposed to other babies increases their communication skills, movement/motor skills, and social-emotional skills such as sharing, confidence, and self esteem.",
