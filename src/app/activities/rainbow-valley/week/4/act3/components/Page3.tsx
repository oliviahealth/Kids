Through this activity, we hope that your toddler has a greater understanding about the animals around them and has built upon their vocabulary! Remember to keep practicing as learning does not happen after one play session! Once your toddler has a good understanding of these animals, try and go see them in real life! This may be as simple as taking a trip to the park or maybe even getting the whole family together and taking a trip to the zoo!`;
