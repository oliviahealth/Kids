The concept of sharing with others, and even taking turns will be very new to your child, which is okay, as they are not expected to fully understand these social skills yet. However, doing activities that involve these skills with your child early on allows them to have more practice with them, which may help their development as they continue to grow older. This activity can be used with a variety of different toys or objects, and is meant to be done for short amounts of time."
