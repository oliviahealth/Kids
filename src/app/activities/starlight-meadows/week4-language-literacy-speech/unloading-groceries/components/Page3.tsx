Frequent exposure to language is beneficial for young children, and can positively impact their language abilities as they grow older. To do activities like this more often in your day to day life, consider talking to your child about their toys, items around the house, clothing, etc. As your child gets older, you can make this more challenging by asking them to point to where things are, or by asking if they like something. `;
